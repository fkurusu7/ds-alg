# Big O Notation

Big O is used to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm as its input approaches INFINITY.
It describes how the time and space requirements of an algorithm grow in relation to the
input size, indicating the algorithm's scalability for large datasets.

O(1) ==> Constant amount of Time and Space.

O(n) ==> Linear. Scales linearly or proportionally with the size of the input.

O(n\*\*2) ==> Quadratic Time/Space. Time and Space requirements grow quadratically
with the size of the input. The performance degrades

O(log n) - Logarithmic Time/Space:

- What are Logarithms? The inverse operation of exponentiation.
