# TWO POINTERS

This technique uses two (or more) pointers that traverse through the structure.
There is no singular way to implement it. It does not have to be physically
using two pointers. As long as the other pointer can be easily calculated from
existing values, such as the index of the other pointer.

A two pointer algorithm has these characteristics:

1. Two moving pointers, regardless of directions, moving depentdently or indepentdently;
2. A function that utilizes the entries referenced by the two pointers, which
   relates to the answer in a way;
3. An easy way of deciding which pointer to move;
4. A way to process the array when the pointers are moved.

## Clasifications (although they are in no way exhaustive)

###Â Same directions

These questions have two pointers that move in the same direction: e.g. Remove Duplicates.

### Opposite Directions

These questions have two pointers that move in the opposite direction. e.g. Two Sum Sorted.

## Two Pointers vs Sliding Window

Sliding window problems are similar to the **Same Directions** problems, only instead, the
function performs on the entire interval between the two pointers; we keep track of the
cumulative result of the window, and each time we insert/remove an item from the window,
we simply update the window according to the changes instead of recalculating everything.
_e.g. Longest Substring without repeating Characters_ is classic sliding window problem.
